## The ASP.NET Monsters "Summer of Config" Contest
Awwwyeah, here it is, the next contest brought to you by the ASP.NET Monsters. We have some great prizes and we're sure hoping that you can have a lot of fun, even if you don't cash in with the win.

The **Summer of Config** is all about creating the wackiest, most insane configuration provider that you can dream up. We want you jammin' on the ASP.NET Core code, bringing us your questions, experimenting with the code and seeing your creativity. _BRING IT ON!_

## We Got You Some Rules
There are a few things that we need you to do in order for your entry to qualify:
 1. Fork from **[our repo on GitHub](https://github.com/AspNetMonsters/SummerOfConfig)** and add your own config source
 2. Write your code! We're looking for non-sensical, exuberance and hilarity
 3. Tweet out _"Hey @aspnetmonsters, I can config #aspnetcore from [your crazy source]"_ with a link to your repo
 4. Complete **[this form](https://1drv.ms/xs/s!ApqEj6IwdD1GmMMA92_UrVJuGkLwVw)** to give us your contact details for when you win
 5. All entries must be emailed and tweeted by Aug 30th at 7:56 PM Central. Not a minute late!
 6. We are leaving it to you to determine if you can/should enter based on the rules of your nation or state or nation state or province or territory.

## How to Win
 **We will unashamedly give bonus points** for physical interaction, so if you have to throw a switch on your desk, or go to a GPS location, or open a window, or brush your teeth to change the config of your website... #winning

 **Impress us with your videos.** If you can either screen cap and walk us through, or video yourself changing the config in some way, that would be hella-cool. This is not a requirement, but we'd love it if you did!
 
 **Be creative with your source** of configuration: arduino, coffee maker, Tardis. The sky and continuum of time are your limits!
 
 **Special consideration will be given** for solutions that run x-plat, meaning, not requiring full framework to run.

If you're looking for an example, check out **[The ASP.NET Monsters Episode 50](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/ASPNET-Monsters-Episode-50-Configuration-From-Any-Source-in-ASPNET-Core)** for a walkthrough of the sample implementation.
